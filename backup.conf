# --- Source and Destination ---
# List all source directories to back up, separated by spaces.
#
# IMPORTANT: Follow these two rules for each path:
# 1. End the path with a trailing slash (e.g., "user/").
# 2. Use "/./" to mark the part of the path you want to create on the destination.
#    Example: "/home/./user/" will create a "user" directory in your BOX_DIR.

# The root folder on the remote server where backups will be placed.
# IMPORTANT: This path MUST end with a trailing slash (e.g., /backups/).
